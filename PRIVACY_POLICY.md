# AudioNav privacy policy

Welcome to AudioNav an audio compass app for Android by Michael Whapples. I wrote AudioNav primarily for my own use and decided to publish it as freeware for others to use.

As a user of Android apps I understand the importance of data privacy and security. I aim to keep data collection and sharing to the minimum required for the correct function of AudioNav. Below is a list of what data is collected and how it is used by the AudioNav app.

1. Any settings you set in AudioNav are only stored locally on your device. Clearing the app storage data should clear any settings.
2. Sensor data will be read to determine the orientation of the device so that the appropriate output can be presented. This data is never stored or transmitted.

This privacy policy may be updated when required, for example when new versions of the app are published to reflect any changes in how data is used by the app.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding data privacy in AudioNav please contact me.

Yours sincerely

Michael Whapples
