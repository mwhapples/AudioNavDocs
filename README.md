# AudioNav
AudioNav is an audio compass app. The primary use is to provide a compass app which can be used for blind sailors, there could be other uses for this app.
## How it works
The user can set a course to follow and depending upon the detected heading as determined by the compass sensor of the phone, audio tones will be emitted. Should the user be to the left of the set course then it emits low beeps, should the user be to the right of the course then high beeps are emitted. The greater the angle between the current heading and the set course will lead to faster beeping.
## System requirements
AudioNav is currently available for Android smart phones. You may install it from the Google Play Store.
